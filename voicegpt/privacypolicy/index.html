    <h1>Privacy Policy for Voice GPT</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 20th Aug, 2023</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy outlines how KannansLab ("we," "our," or "us")
      collects, uses, and safeguards information obtained from users ("you" or
      "your") of the Voice GPT Android application ("the App"). By using the
      App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Voice Data:</strong> The App uses the OpenAI API to access and
        convert user voice recordings into text for further processing. We
        collect and store these voice recordings temporarily in order to
        facilitate the conversion process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Converted Text:</strong> The text resulting from the voice
        conversion process is also stored temporarily to enable the App to read
        it aloud to the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect certain information
        about your device, including device type, operating system, and unique
        device identifiers. This information is used for technical purposes to
        improve the performance and compatibility of the App.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Voice Conversion:</strong> The primary purpose of collecting and
        processing your voice recordings is to convert them into text using the
        OpenAI API. This text is then used for the subsequent reading
        functionality of the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App Functionality:</strong> The converted text is used to enable
        the App to read aloud the content you've provided through voice input.
        This functionality is designed to enhance user experience and
        accessibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improvement of Services:</strong> We may use the information
        collected to analyze usage patterns, identify areas for improvement, and
        enhance the overall functionality and performance of the App.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- More sections of the policy -->

    <p>
      <strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain your voice recordings and
      converted text for a limited period of time necessary for the conversion
      process and the subsequent reading functionality. This data is stored
      securely and is not used for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <!-- More sections of the policy -->

    <p>
      <strong>Data Security:</strong> We implement industry-standard security
      measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
      alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the
      internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot
      guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <!-- More sections of the policy -->

    <p>
      <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The App uses the OpenAI API to
      facilitate the voice-to-text conversion process. Your use of the OpenAI
      API is subject to OpenAI's terms and privacy practices. We recommend
      reviewing OpenAI's Privacy Policy for further information.
    </p>

    <!-- More sections of the policy -->

    <p>
      <strong>Your Choices:</strong> You have the right to choose whether to

      recordings, certain features of the App may not function as intended.
    </p>

    <!-- More sections of the policy -->

    <p>
      <strong>Changes to Privacy Policy:</strong> We reserve the right to update
      or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. You will be notified of any
